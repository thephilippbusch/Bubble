# Bubble

Bubble is a Micro-Service Framework aimed to quickly build and deploy efficient, lightweight services. The entire Micro-Service is run in a Docker Container for both Production-Ready uses as well as development purposes. The Tech-Stack is initially setup with a Solid JS Server-Side Frontend, a FastAPI Backend and a PostgresQL Database.
